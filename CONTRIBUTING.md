## Sign our contributor agreement

All contributions to this project must be accompanied by a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about)
(CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us
permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

If you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it was for a different
project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Style guides

Before starting check out the relevant [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for the language you will be using. These apply
strictly to raw code files (e.g. *.py, *.js), though code fragments in documentation (such as markdown
files or notebooks) tend to favor readability over strict adherence.

# Making changes

## Small fixes

Small fixes, such as typos or bug fixes, can be submitted directly via a pull request.

## Large changes

Before starting work on any large change, please file an
[issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/example-chat-app/issues).
There we can discuss the request and provide guidance.
